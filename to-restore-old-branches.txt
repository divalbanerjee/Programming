============================
Restoring Archived Branches
============================

To avoid clutter, some old branches have been archived and deleted.
Currently, these branches are:

--"power-on-test-dev" - redundant to "power-on-test"

To restore any of these branches, use:

	git checkout -b <branchname> archive/<branchname>

This will restore the branch from the archive.
